# SpQL

SpQL is an easier way of querying SharePoint's web servies. It abstracts away a lot the complexity and redundancy of constructing SOAP requests into an easy to use API.

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save spql

```js
import spql from "spql";
```

The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/spql@1/dist/spql.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.spql`.
